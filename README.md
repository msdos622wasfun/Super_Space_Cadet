# Super_Space_Cadet
 A text-based console space adventure game.

Super Space Cadet is a turn-based, text/console space strategy game that is a throwback to similar games of the past such as Super Star Trek.  It is essentially a clone, with various enhancements added to it.  Although it uses text mode, it is in fact a 32-bit Windows application.

This program was written in GLBasic.  The executable file is in the Super_Space_Cadet.app folder.
